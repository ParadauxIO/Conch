# Conch 1.0 by RÃ­an Errity <rian@paradaux.io> Licensed under GPLv3 | Bot Configuration.

// Conch comes bundled with a built-in discord bot. In order to make use of this you must create a discord
// token and place it between the double quotes ("") in the token field on line 8. The discord bot permits you to have
// discord messages show up in game.

// Set this to true to enable the built-in discord bot.

enabled: false

// The Bot Token is your API key so Conch can talk to discord as a bot. You must create the bot account here:
// https://discord.com/developers/applications Please see https://hiberniadiscrd.paradaux.io/#/bot-configuration for
// more user-friendly instructions.

// In order for your discord bot to see the messages in your discord server you must also invite the discord bot to your
// discord server. Please see https://hiberniadiscrd.paradaux.io/#/bot-configuration for more explicit instructions as
// to how to do this.

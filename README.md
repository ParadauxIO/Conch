## Introduction

Conch is a lightweight Minecraft <-> Discord Bridge allowing you to syncronise in-game messages with a channel on your discord via discord-webhooks and an integrated discord bot. Users will appear as "bots" with their player head as the avatar. Using the Integrated Discord Bot you can configure discord messages to appear in game. 

Conch 4.0.0 is designed to be modular. It is based around a "core" which provides all necessary functionality, then platform-specific implementations via modules. 

Conch supports all major Minecraft Server and Proxy Implementations 
- Bukkit-based (Paper, Spigot etc) 
- Sponge7-based (Spongeforge & Spongevanilla)
- Velocity
- Bungeecord

You can expect Fabric and Sponge8 support in late Q1-Early Q2 of 2021

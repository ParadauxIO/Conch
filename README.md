## Introduction

Conch is a lightweight and modular Discord bridge allowing you to syncronise in-game messages in Minecraft with a channel on your discord via discord-webhooks and an integrated discord bot. Users will appear as "bots" with their player head as the avatar. Using the Integrated Discord Bot you can configure discord messages to appear in game. 

Conch is designed to be modular. It is based around a "core" which provides all necessary functionality, then platform-specific implementations via modules. 

Conch is still in **active development** At this time I do not recommend using any development builds on production servers. You can find a list of alternatives as follows:
- EssentialsX Discord (Bukkit)
- DiscordSrv (Bukkit)

Conch supports all major Minecraft Server and Proxy Implementations 
- Bukkit-based (Paper, Spigot etc) 
- Sponge7-based (Spongeforge & Spongevanilla)
- Velocity
- Bungeecord

There are currently plans to support these additional platforms in the future
- Fabric
- Matrix
- IRC

## Installation Instructions

All Installation Instructions have been moved to the HiberniaDiscord website.
